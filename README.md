### 🧠 Developer | 🎮 Gamer | ⚙️ Minecraft Plugin Creator

Hey! I'm a 20-year-old developer from Romania, and I have a thing for making games *feel alive*.  
From Minecraft plugins to custom game systems, I love turning wild ideas into something players can actually interact with.

For over **3 years**, I’ve been creating Minecraft plugins — everything from unique shop systems to mechanics that completely change gameplay.  
And I’ve been developing games for **4+ years**, constantly experimenting with effects, particles, and weird mechanics that make players go:

> “Wait… how did you do that?! 🤯”
